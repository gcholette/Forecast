# Forecast :sun_behind_rain_cloud:

Fetch and aggregate data from various meteorological sources to estimate an hourly forecast (Unfinished).

Currently working on support for GEPS and RDPS analysis (from [CMC](https://weather.gc.ca/mainmenu/modelling_menu_e.html)).

HRDPS works somewhat, need to figure out when to use different "run hours" otherwise it may hit 404s.
